Let $K$ be the subfield of $F$. $F$ is a vector space over $K$, finite-dimensional since $F$ is finite. Denote this dimension by $m$. Then $F$ has a basis over $K$ consisting of $m$ elementes. let it be $b_1,b_2...b_m$. Every element of $F$ can be uniquely represented in the form $k_1b_1+...k_mb_m$(where $k_1,...k_m\in K$) Since each $k_i \in K$ can take q values. Then $F$ must have exactly $q^m$ elements.$\square$

#### Lemma
 Let $g \in G$ and $g$ have order $n$. Then $g^{k}=e$ if and only if $n \mid k$.
 If $n \mid k$, say $k=n m$, then $g^{k}=g^{n m}=\left(g^{n}\right)^{m}=e$. For the converse direction, we use the division theorem. Supposing that $g^{k}=e$, write $k=n q+r$ with integers $q$ and $r$ such that $0 \leq r<n$. Then
$$
e=g^{k}=\left(g^{n}\right)^{q} g^{r}=g^{r}
$$
Since $0 \leq r<n$, the minimality built into $n$ as the order of $g$ forces $r$ to be zero. Thus $k=n q$, so $n \mid k$


#### Proof
From the problem we have $g_{1}$ has order $n_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ has order $n_{2}$, with $(n_1,n_2)=1$, we are to proof $g_1,g_2$ has order $n_1,n_2$. Since
$$
\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right)^{n_{1} n_{2}}=g_{1}^{n_{1} n_{2}} g_{2}^{n_{1} n_{2}}=\left(g_{1}^{n_{1}}\right)^{n_{2}}\left(g_{2}^{n_{2}}\right)^{n_{1}}=e
$$
we see $g_{1} g_{2}$ has finite order, which must divide $n_{1} n_{2}$ by Theorem $3.4$. Let $n$ be the order of $g_{1} g_{2}$. In particular, $\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right)^{n}=e$. From this we will show $n_{1} \mid n$ and $n_{2} \mid n$. Since $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ commute,
$$
g_{1}^{n} g_{2}^{n}=e
$$
Raising both sides of $g_{1}^{n} g_{2}^{n}=e$ to the power $n_{2}$ (to kill off the $g_{2}$ factor) gives
$$
g_{1}^{n n_{2}}=e
$$
Therefore $n_{1} \mid n n_{2}$ by Lemma. Since $\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\right)=1$, we conclude $n_{1} \mid n .$ Now raising both sides of $g_{1}^{n} g_{2}^{n}=e$ to the power $n_{1}$ gives $g_{2}^{n n_{1}}=e$, so $n_{2} \mid n n_{1}$ by Lemma, and thus $n_{2} \mid n$
Since $n_{1}\left|n, n_{2}\right| n$ and $\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\right)=1$, we conclude that $n_{1} n_{2} \mid n .$ Since we already showed $n \mid n_{1} n_{2}$ (in the first paragraph of the proof), we conclude $n=n_{1} n_{2}$.$\square$

The proposition can be extended to a more general one. If $F$ is a field and $G$ a finite subgroup of $F^{\times}$, then $G$ is cyclic. This follow from the same hint: With $n=|G|$, we have $g^{n}=1$ for all $g \in G$, hence all $g \in G$ are roots of the polynomial $X^{n}-1 \in F[X]$. 

Since there are at most $n$ such roots, the elements of $G$ are precisely the $n$ roots of the polynomial $X^{n}-1$. Now let $g$ be a root of $X^{n}-1$, but not of $X^{d}-1$ for any $d \mid n$ 

Then clearly $G=\langle g\rangle.\square$

$P(x,y)= xyâˆ’y^2$
**Check:**
The latter is obviously satisfied.
For first equation: if $X=Y-1, P(x,y)=y^2-y-y^2\ (mod\ y-1 )\equiv 1$

$n_{1}=7$
$n_{2}=16$
$n_{3}=10$
$N=n_{1} \cdot n_{2} \cdot n_{3}=1120$
$m_{1}=\frac{N}{n_{1}}=160$
$m_{2}=\frac{N}{n_{2}}=70$
$m_{3}=\frac{N}{n_{3}}=112$
$\operatorname{gcd}\left(m_{1}, n_{1}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}(160,7)=1 $ so $y_{1}=1$ and $x_{1}=160$
$\operatorname{gcd}\left(m_{2}, n_{2}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}(70,16)=2$ so $y_{2}=2$ and $x_{2}=70$
$\operatorname{gcd}\left(m_{3}, n_{3}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}(112,10)=-2$ so $y_{3}=-2$ and $x_{3}=-112$

So $x=160 \times 3+70 \times 4-112 \times 2 \equiv 584(\bmod 1120)$

These are dihedral group:D8 and quaternion group

First let generalize the problem, let 8 be any prime number $p^3$.


#### Lemma
**Given:** A prime number $p$, a group $P$ of order $p^{3}$.
**To prove:** Either $P$ is abelian, or we have: $Z(P)$ is a cyclic group of order $p$ and $P / Z(P)$ is an elementary abelian group of order $p^{2}$
**Proof:** Let $Z=Z(P)$ be the center of $P$.
$P$ has order $p^{3}$, specifically, a power of a prime, so $Z$ is non trivial. $P$ has order $p^3$, $ P / Z$ exists by the fact that center is normal and has order $|P| /|Z|$ by Lagrange's theorem. If $Z$ has order $p^{2}$, the order of $P / Z$ is $p^{3} / p^{2}=p$. By the quaivalence of definitions of group of prime order, $P / Z$ must be cyclic. Then, by the fact that cyclic over central implies abelian, $P$ would be abelian, but this would imply that $Z=P$, in which case the order of $Z$ would have been $p^{3}$. So, the order of $Z$ can not be $p^2$

By Lagrange's theorem,  the order of $Z$ must divide the order of $P$. The only possibilities are $1, p, p^{2}, p^{3}$. Step the frist process eliminates the possibility of 1 , and the second process eliminates the possibility of $p^{2}$. This leaves only $p$ or $p^{3}$.

If $Z$ has order $p$, then $Z$ must be cyclic. $P / Z$ exists and its order is $|P| /|Z|=p^{3} / p=p^{2}$. $P / Z$ cannot be cyclic, because if it were cyclic, then $P$ would be abelian, which would mean that $Z=P$ has order $p^{3}$. Thus, $P / Z$ is a non-cyclic group of order $p^{2}$. By classification of groups of prime-square order, the only non-cyclic group of order $p^{2}$ is the elementary abelian group, so $P / Z$ must be the elementary abelian group of order $p^{2}$. If $Z$ has order $p$, then $Z$ is cyclic of order $p$ and the quotient $P / Z$ is elementary abelian of order $p^{2}$

If $Z$ has order $p^{3},$ we get $P=Z, P$ is abelian.

#### Classifying the non-abelian groups
**Case A:** $a$ and $b$ both have order $p$.
In this case, the relations so far give the presentation:
$\left\langle a, b, z \mid a^{p}=b^{p}=z^{p}=e, a z=z a, b z=z b,[a, b]=z\right\rangle$
These relations already restrict us to order at most $p^{3}$, because we can use the commutation relations to express every element in the form $a^{\alpha} b^{\beta} z^{\gamma}$, where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are integers mod $p$. To show that there is no further reduction, we note that there is a group of order $p^{3}$ satisfying all these relations, namely unitriangular matrix group:UT (3,p). This is the multiplicative group of unipotent upper-triangular matrices with entries from the field of $p$ elements. Thus, Case A gives a unique isomorphism class of groups. Note that the analysis so far works both for $p=2$ and for odd primes. The nature of the group obtained, though, is different for $p=2$, where we get dihedral group:D8 which has exponent $p^{2}$. For odd primes, we get a group of prime exponent.

**Case B:** $a$ has order $p^{2}, b$ has order $p$ In this case, we first note that $a^{p} \in Z=\langle z\rangle$. Since $a^{p}$ is a non-identity element, there exists nonzero $r$ (taken mod $p$ ) such that $a^{p}=z^{r}$. Consider the element $c=b^{r}$ Then, by Fact thatClass two implies commutator map is endomorphism, and the observation that $P$ has class two (Step (1) in the above table), we obtain:
$[a, c]=\left[a, b^{r}\right]=[a, b]^{r}=z^{r}=a^{p}$
Consider the presentation:
$\left\langle a, c \mid a^{p^{2}}=c^{p}=e,[a, c]=a^{p}\right\rangle$
We see that all these relations are forced by the above, and further, that this presentation defines a group of order $p^{3}$, namely semidirect product of cyclic group of prime-square order and cyclic group of prime order.
Thus, there is a unique isomorphism class in Case B. Note that the analysis so far works both for $p=2$ and for odd primes. The nature of the group, though, is different for $p=2$, we get dihedral group:D8, which is the same isomorphism class as Case A.

**Case B2:** $a$ has order $p, b$ has order $p^{2}$. Interchange the roles of $a, b$ and replace $z$ by $z^{-1}$ and we are back in Case B. 

**Case C:** $a$ and $b$ both have order $p^{2}$.
By Fact that Formula for powers of product in group of class two, we can show that for odd prime, it is possible to make a substitution and get into Case B. 
For $p=2$, working out the presentation yields quaternion group.
Here is a summary of the cases:
